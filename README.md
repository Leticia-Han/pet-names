# Generating pet names - creating an R Keras model and deploying it in a Docker container

This repository creates a docker image that uses R and the [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/) and [plumber](https://github.com/trestletech/plumber) R packages to create a neural network powered RESTful API. The package keras provides the ability to create neural networks, while plumber allows it to run R as a web service.

This is an introductory repository to help R users learn about keras, plumber, and Docker. A more featureful version of this code can be found at the [T-Mobile open-source r-tensorflow-api project](https://github.com/tmobile/r-tensorflow-api).

The Docker container is currently being hosted on the Nolis, LLC website, and can be queried by visiting [http://pets.nolisllc.com/names](http://pets.nolisllc.com/names).

This code was used in talks by [Jacqueline Nolis](https://twitter.com/skyetetra) and [Heather Nolis](https://twitter.com/heatherklus) at the New York R Conference in May of 2019.

## How to use this repository

This repository has four different parts to it:

1. __Training a neural network on pet names__ - Running the R script `train_model.R` will:
   1. load up the pet names csv,
   2. format them into X and Y matrices that a neural network can be trained on, 
   3. defines the keras neural network model,
   4. trains the neural network on the data,
   5. saves the trained model to `model.h5`.
2. __Defines a function to generate new pet names__ - Running the R script `runtime_functions.R` loads the neural network model and parameters, then creates functions to generate the pet names. There are two functions in the code:
   1.  `generate_name` - Uses the model to generate a single pet name
   2.  `generate_many_names` - calls the previous function a specified number of times to get a vector of names.
3. __Create a RESTful API around the pet name generator function__ - The R scripts `rest_controller.R` and `main.R` together allow you to run the generate as an API, so that you can get pet names via HTTP requests. Running `main.R` starts the web service.
4. __Building a Docker image for the API__ - The file `Dockerfile` specifies how the Docker image should be built. To build and run the Docker container, download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), then in a terminal run `docker build -t pet-names .` and `docker run --rm -p 80:80 pet-names`
